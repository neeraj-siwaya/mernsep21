Difference btw function declaration and expressions:

1. Functions delaration are hoisted to the top i.e. when a js file is loaded all the
function declarations are moved to the top of the file which means a declared function
can be invoked before its declaration.

Function expression are not hoisted.

2. Function declaration are part of the global scope i.e. they are available
througout the application.

Function expressions are part of the defined scope i.e. they are available 
in the block where they are defined. For this reason, they are used mainly i.e.
they don't pollute the global scope.

Arrow functions or fat arrow function: Are anonymous function expression which are defined
as follows:
// If function body has only one statement;
(args if any) => statement;
// If function body has only multiple statements;
(args if any) => {
    statements;
}

Other global objects of Node:

1. setTimeout(): Is a function which is used to execute a callback function after
the given time. 
A function or function expression which is passed as parameter to another function
is known as callback function.
syntax of setTimeout:

setTimeout(callback, timeInMilliseconds);

2. clearTimeout(): Is used to clear a timeout.
syntax:
clearTimeout(timeoutRef);

3. setInterval(): Is a function which is used to execute a callback function repeateadly
after the given time. 

syntax of setTimeout:

setInterval(callback, timeInMilliseconds);

4. clearInterval(): Is used to clear interval.
clearTimeout(intervalRef);

etc.

Execution of a program can be synchrouns or asynchronous.

in synchronous programming, we perform an action and wait for its completion 
before doing something else.

In Asynchronous programming, we perform an action and without waiting for its 
completion start doing something else. When the old task completes, we get its
result and use it.

Node uses event loop for async programming.

this keyword: 

In JavaScript, each function has a property named this which represents the function context i.e. in 
simple words this represents the object using which the function is invoked.

When a JavaScript is executed two types of contexts are created:

1. Global context
2. Functional context

A context can be thought of as an object which has some properties and functions.


In order to understand the concept of this better we need to divide the functions in two categories:

1. Normal function
2. Method

A normal function is a function which is defined in the global context.
A method is a function which is defined within an object.

In order to invoke methods, we need objects i.e. methods are invoked as follows:

objName.methodName(args if any);

so, in case of methods, "this" always refers to the invoking object.

Uses of this keyword:

1. it is used to define constructor functions (classes in JS). A constructor function is used
for creating objects with different values. It uses this to represent object properties.

e.g. here Person is a constructor function. It receives two parameters and creates a new object and
assigns the parameters values to the object.


var Person = function(name, age){
    this.name = name; 
    this.age = age;
    this.display= function(){ // Method
        console.log(this.name+' is '+this.age+' years old.'); // In case of method, this always represents the current object.
    }
}

2. this keyword is used to pass the original context to a callback method so that callback method can use
the properties of the original context.

In async programming, we use callback methods to do something in future.

e.g. forEach() loop provided by JS can be used to understand the use of callbacks in async programming.

syntax of forEach() loop:

arrayProperty.forEach(callbackfunction);

This loop works in the following manner:

1. It iterate array elements one by one.
2. In each iteration, callback function is invoked by passing the current element as argument.

The callback that we are passing in the forEach will be executing within the context of forEach. it will not
have the invoking context available but sometimes that is requred.
As in our case we want to refer the name of invoking object within the callback.

In such case, invoking contexts need to be passed through this.

e.g. arrayProperty.forEach(callbackfunction, invokingcontext);

To solve this problem of losing the original context in callback functions, concept of arrow functions was 
introduced in ES5.
Main difference b/w an arrow and a normal is related to this keyword.
In a normal function, this points to the global object.
In an arrow function, this point to the current object.

12/09/21
In JavaScript applications, most of the times we need to use third party libraries i.e. we need to invoke
functions which have different context than current context.

In such cases, we need some mechanism to pass current context to these libararies so that they can execute
our code properly.

Each JS function is object and has some methods one of them is call() which receives the context as argument. 
It is used to invoke
third party with different contexts.

syntax: 
1. functionName.call(context);
2. functionName.call(context, arg1, arg2, ...);

All these arguments will be stored in the arguments object of the invoked function.
Each function in JS also has a property named arguments which is an object and contains the arguments passed to 
function.

apply(): apply() method is similar to call except that it receives arguemtns as array.

2. functionName.apply(context, argumentsArray);



bind(): is another method of functions which is used to create a new funtion by binding the
given function to the given context.

Syntax: var functionName = currentFunction.bind(context, arguements);

Closure: is a context which is generated when a nested function uses the variables of the outer function.
It facilitate the use of outer function variable in inner function even after the execution of outer function.

Immediately invoked function(IIFI) or self invoked functions:

An Immediately invoked function is a function which is Immediately invoked just after it is loaded
i.e. it doesn't require an explicit statement for its invocation.

syntax:
(function(args if any){
    function body;
})(required args);

Use cases of IIFIs: 
1. An IIFI acts as a wrapper for other functions and variables and prevents name conflicts. All third party
libraries are mainly provided in the form of iifis to isolate their variables with the application code.

What is ReactJs?

ReactJs is libarary for creating User Interfaces.  It can be used in single HTML or in a 
complex web applications.

In React, we assume that each web page is a collection of components. A component is UI element which
can be as simple as a button or text field or a label or as complex as an entire page.

React advocates building complex UIs by composing simple components.

In order to understand the use of components in React, we need to understand React Elements.

A React Element is a JS object which represent a UI/HTML (DOM) element in json format, without 
the extra baggage of DOM.

ReactJs provides React object in React library which provides methods for creating element.

createElement(): is used to create Element object.

syntax: React.createElement('HTML Element or React Component Name', attribute list, children);

To render react elements to DOM, ReactDOM library is used.

React Component: Is a function or class which receives an optional parameter props and returns 
an Element object.

In other words, we have two types of components in React:
1. Functional Component
2. Class Component

Syntax of defining a functional component:

function ComponentName(props?) {
    return element*;
}
Notes: 
? - represents optional
* - here element represents an object of type ReactElement.

To simplify developoment of components, React introduced the context of JSX i.e. extended Java JavaScript 
which is the combination of JS & HTML.

To compile JSX into pure JS, Babel transpiler is used. Babel is a tool which converts JSX into 
JavaScript.

Syntax of defining a class component:

class ComponentName extends React.Component{
    render(){
        element
    }
}

Here we are defining class which is inheriting the Component class of the React library.

A functional component directly returns an Element whereas in a class component render() method
returns the element.


Components can be further categorized as follows:

1. Stateless components
2. Stateful components

State represents data which is used in a UI.
